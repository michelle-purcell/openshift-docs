= Gathering data on demand with the Insights Operator from the OpenShift CLI

You can run a custom Insights Operator gather operation on-demand from the  {product-title} command-line interface (CLI). 
An on-demand `DataGather` operation is useful for one-off data collections that require different configurations to the periodic data gathering (`InsightsDataGather`) specification.

Use the following procedure to create a `DataGather` custom resource definition (CRD), and then run the data gather operation on demand from the CLI.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to {product-title} as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with the following `DataGather` specification:
+
[source,yaml]
----

apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
# Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: All # Options: All, Custom
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* The name you specify for your gather operation, `<your_data_gather>`, must be unique and must not include a prefix of `periodic-gathering-` because this string is reserved for other administrative operations and might impact the intended gather operation.
* If the `spec` of `DataGather` CRD is undefined, the default Insights Operator data collection job will run. This means that all gather operations will run, the collected data will be unobfuscated and the archive file will not be retained.
====
+
. Optional: To customize the data gather operation, you can configure any of the following options in your `DataGather` YAML file:
* To disable specific gatherers, change the value of `mode` to *Custom*, and then specify the individual gatherer that you intend to disable. For example, to disable the workload gatherer, add the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> 
spec:
    # Gatherers configuration
  gatherers:
    mode: Custom  # Options: All, Custom
    custom:
      configs:
        # Essential cluster configuration gatherers
        - name: clusterconfig/authentication
          state: Enabled
        - name: clusterconfig/clusteroperators
          state: Enabled
        - name: workloads
          state: Disabled
----
* To enable persistent storage to retain the data archive file and history for up to the last 10 data gathering jobs, define the `storage` specification. Set *type* to `PersistentVolume`, and define the `mountPath` and `name` of the volume, as outlined in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather>
spec:
  storage:
    type: PersistentVolume
    mountPath: /data
    persistentVolume:
      claim:
        name: on-demand-gather-pvc
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the volume name specified matches the existing `PersistentVolumeClaim` value in the `openshift-insights` namespace. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/storage/understanding-persistent-storage#persistent-volume-claims_understanding-persistent-storage[Persistent volume claims].
====
+
* To enable data obfuscation, define the `dataPolicy` key and required values. For example, to obfuscate IP addresses and workload names, add the following configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: insights.openshift.io/v1alpha2
kind: DataGather
metadata:
  name: <your_data_gather> 
spec:
  dataPolicy:
    - ObfuscateNetworking
    - WorkloadNames
----
+
. On the {product-title} CLI, enter the following command to run the gather operation:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <your_data_gather_definition>.yaml
----

.Verification

* Check that your new gather operation is prefixed with your chosen name under the list of pods in the `openshift-insights` project. Upon completion, the Insights Operator automatically uploads the data to Red Hat for processing.
